Enable Mouse\/Touch Signature - select this box if you want to enable users to sign using their mouse or touchscreen.

Expiration Date - select an expiration date and time for the file. If no expiration date is entered, the file will expire after 180 days. You must enter the date in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD and the time in HH:MM. Whatever time you select from the time picker, or enter into the field, the file will expire at the time specified based on your portal's time zone.

A document can contain a limitless number of signature fields for Initials. Date - This box displays the date of signing. A document can contain a limitless number of signature fields for Dates. Company - this box displays the company name of the signer. A document can contain a limitless number of Company fields. Title - this field displays the title of the signer (e.g. CEO, Marketing Manager, Event Coordinator, etc). Titles are self-selected by the signer and cannot be altered by document owners. A document can contain a limitless number of signature fields for Titles. Custom Field - The custom field displays whatever information you specify to collect. For example, you can create a Custom Field named \"Beverage Choice\" that can accept inputs like \"coffee\", \"water\", \"soda\", and so on. Enter the custom information in the Custom Text box before you insert these fields onto the document. A document can contain a limitless number of Custom Fields. Short Custom Field - The small custom field displays whatever information you specify to collect. Enter the custom information in the Custom Text box before you select the field. A document can contain a limitless number of Short Custom Fields. Checkmarks enable signers to \"check off\", or formally acknowledge, a particular section or provision of a document. For instance, a signer can acknowledge that no smoking is permitted at your facility by completing a Checkmark field next to a sentence saying \"Check this box to confirm your receipt and acceptance of our smoking policy\". There is no limit to the number of Checkmark fields you can put on a document. Labels let your signers add notes or other bits of information to the document.

Signature forms  can include an actual contract with a dedicated space for client signature, or an authorization form that requires a signature. You can add frequently used signature documents as templates to your Document Library to quickly and easily include the signature documents in your file. It's a best practice to only include signature documents in the Document Library that are frequently used and don't require much customization. If you're sending signature documents that contain confidential information, you should attach the signature documents when you send a file, rather than adding that document to the Document Library. Reference documents  typically supplement the your signature forms or authorization forms in some way. These documents can be instructions for signing the signature document, or other information like venue maps and catering menus. You can create  signature location templates  for frequently used, but not editable, documents. For instance, if you have a scanned copy of a form that requires signature or other information from your clients, but are unable to edit the form with a PDF editor, you can create it as a signature location template. When documents are sent via Sertifi, each page of the document receives a DocumentID stamp in the lower-left hand corner of the page to indicate that the document was processed via the Sertifi system.

"body" : "You have two ways to provision users for SSO. You can employ Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning or Ahead-of-time (AOT) provisioning. JIT provisioning is an option to have Sertifi automatically create a new profile for a user if they don't have an existing Sertifi profile. This profile is assigned to the email address you provide to Sertifi, along with the optional first and last name values. This profile is then tied to the user's ID for future logins. This profile's initial role is User ( see more about Sertifi Roles ) If you want the user to have Admin or higher access, the Super Admin for the portal must update the user via the Create Admin page in the portal, or by Sertifi Support. Sertifi can disable JIT provisioning by request. AOT provisioning is the option to give users, without an existing Sertifi profile, full Admin or higher access from their initial log in. Sertifi can create profiles for these users that are tied to the user's IDs in your system. To do this, you must provide Sertifi with: The users' email addresses The users' system IDs The users' assigned role (User, Admin, etc) Alternatively, the Super Admin can also create the profiles via the Create Admin page in the portal, so when the users log in with SSO for the first time, they're already associated with the correct profile. If you have multiple users that you want to add to the Sertifi portal via AOT provisioning, you can use a Bulk Send to transmit the above information for each user to Sertifi. In some cases, a user might have Admin or higher access to multiple Sertifi portals. When the user logs in with SSO, the user can access each portal they have Admin or higher access to via a dropdown in the top right side of the portal, next to their username. However, if the user doesn't have Admin or higher access to multiple portals, you have the option for those users to default directly to the portals they can access.
